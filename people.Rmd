__Stephanie Hicks__

Stephanie Hicks is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She develops statistical methods, tools and software for the analysis of genomics data. Her research addresses statistical challenges in epigenomics, functional genomics and single-cell genomics
such as the pre-processing, normalization, analysis of raw, noisy high-throughput data (microarray and next-generation sequencing) leading to improved quantification and understanding of biological variability. She taught the major [data science course](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/) at Harvard before joining the faculty at Johns Hopkins. She also writes the blog [Statistical Recipes](http://statisticalrecipes.blogspot.com/) which combines statistics and cooking (yum!).

## Staff

__Jessica Crowell__

Jessica is a videographer and editor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics.  After graduating with a BFA in Video and Film from MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art), she joined the department in 2015. Since then, Jessica has shot and edited over three hundred MOOCs, a short documentary of the Biostat Dept. and its history, and has also created many other promo videos (sometimes involving puppets or animation). She is driven to maintain a collaborative balance between creativity and academic integrity, working closely with the members of Data Science Lab and members of the faculty to support them in all their endeavors.


__Ira Gooding__

Ira Gooding is Manager of the Open Education Lab in the Center for Teaching and Learning at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He has contributed to the development of more than 50 massive open online courses and specializations, including the Data Science, Executive Data Science, Genomic Data Science Specializations. Ira is also Provostâ€™s Fellow for Digital Initiatives.

__Mike Orzechowski__

As a Program Coordinator/Open Education Developer, I construct and maintain Massive Open Online Courses (such as those on Coursera, OCW, etc.) for JHSPH and some for the School of Medicine, and other departments. This includes the courses in Psychological First Aid, Introduction to Cancer Biology, Systematic Review and Data Analysis, etc., as well as Course Specializations such as the Data Science Specialization, Genomic Data Science Specialization, etc. on Coursera. This construction and maintenance includes using editing software (Captivate, Camtasia, etc.) to edit the video and audio of lectures for publication, creating syllabi out of given content, fixing errors and glitches in the active courses, and overseeing that the courses are complete and appropriate for the platform.
