__Stephanie Hicks__

Stephanie Hicks is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She develops statistical methods, tools and software for the analysis of genomics data. Her research addresses statistical challenges in epigenomics, functional genomics and single-cell genomics
such as the pre-processing, normalization, analysis of raw, noisy high-throughput data (microarray and next-generation sequencing) leading to improved quantification and understanding of biological variability. She taught the major [data science course](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/) at Harvard before joining the faculty at Johns Hopkins. She also writes the blog [Statistical Recipes](http://statisticalrecipes.blogspot.com/) which combines statistics and cooking (yum!).
