* [didactr](https://github.com/muschellij2/didactr): The goal of didactr is to leverage the ‘ari’ package and other tools to create automated courses from slides and a script. Also, uploads these to YouTube and other servies, with the option of translation.

* [ari](https://github.com/muschellij2/ari): Ari is an R package designed to help you make videos from plain text files. Ari uses Amazon Polly to convert your text into speech. You can then provide images or a set of HTML slides which Ari will narrate based on a script you provide. Ari uses FFmpeg to stitch together audio and images.
