The Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab is a group of researchers, educators, software developers, and video production experts whose goal is to make data science accessible to the whole world. 

The Data Science Lab started as an effort by faculty in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/)
at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) but has now expanded to include collaborations with [Computer Science](http://www.jhsph.edu/), [Biology](http://www.jhsph.edu/), [Biomedical Engineering](http://www.jhsph.edu/), [Medicine](http://www.jhsph.edu/), and [The Center for Teaching and Learning](http://www.jhsph.edu/). 

Our efforts focus on large-scale human data interaction including: 

* Massive online open courses that have enrolled more than 8 million people around the world
* The swirl software platform for interactive R learning in R
* Books, blogs, and podcasts on data science, statistics, and academia
* Data app prototyping and entrepreneurship with a focus on public health
